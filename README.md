# CWHageman Portfolio
This website is a portfolio that's contains projects I have done due to needs being filled or just randomly wanting to try some things out.

## Frameworks/Libraries used
No libraries or frameworks were used on this website.

## Backend
Due to the simplicity of this site I have chosen to use Firebase as my store. Because of this I am using Firebase as my serverless backend using Cloud Functions.

## Standards
### CSS
I am using the naming convention rules from BEM as a standard.
